# Whatsapp Clone

A clone of the popular messaging application, Whatsapp, made with Angular and Spring Boot. For this project, I followed [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot7QE_gzhtA) tutorial by Cyril from CodeCake. 

## Motivation
I picked this project because I wanted to develop proficiency in building applications with Spring Boot and Angular, and I am also interested in building a chat application. I decided to follow a tutorial for a few reasons: 
1. More time-efficient to learn and complete the project;
2. Being a full-stack tutorial, it allows me to see the whole process of building the application;
2. I wanted to learn how other people's approach in software development, such as the design patterns and architectural styles they used.
